# Results obtained from this benchmark may be published only under the
# name "HBench-OS".
#

# This is the default test file that runs all HBench-OS tests.
#
# Each line in this file that does not begin with a "#" is treated as a
# directive to execute a test. Lines that do not contain at least one ":"
# are ignored. The format of each line is:
#     test_name:params0:params1:...:paramsN
# where test_name is the name of the executable that implements the test,
# and each of the paramsK contains the parameters for the Kth invocation
# of that test. For example, to measure process creation for both
# simple static and simple dynamic processes, you would add the following]
# line:
#
#     lat_proc:simple static:simple dynamic
#
# Note that there is no trailing ":", even if the benchmark takes no
# parameters.
#
# This file is parsed automatically by hbench/scripts/maindriver; the parsing
# engine is not particularly robust with syntax that does not conform to the
# above, so undefined behavior may result if the specified syntax is not
# followed.
